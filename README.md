#Campus Event Management Platform :
The platform is MERN stack application , and based on the assignment , the Admin page is web based and thus, 
uses React.js while the Student page is app based  and uses Ract Native .
The inspiration for the app compes from a combination of Luma events and Salesforce.

I started off by planning to build this project using PostgresSql with Docker containerization , with python
backend , which after few hours of trying I understood that it was not possible because of too many bugs ,
Later I switched to MERN based tech stack for faster prototyping , Once the basic prototype was ready , 
I went ahead and added more features like serching, filters, feedback, analytics for better privacy , usability and more 
detailed usage by convesing with AI about different scenerios.
